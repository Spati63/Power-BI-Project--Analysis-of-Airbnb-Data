# Power-BI-Project--Analysis-of-Airbnb-Data
Data Description:

The necessary data and data dictionaries are available as CSV files.

The Reviews (Reviews.csv) dataset contains information about reviews left for Airbnb listings, while the Listings (Listings.csv) dataset contains all relevant details about the listed stays. Comprehensive descriptions of each column can be found in their respective data dictionary files (Listings_data_dictionary.csv and Reviews_data_dictionary.csv)

Business Objective:

The primary objective is to analyze Airbnb data to reveal insights into user experiences and satisfaction levels with the numerous listed stays, all accomplished using Power BI.


Project Goals:

Assessing District Location Scores: The aim is to pinpoint the location in the district with the least favorable location scores.

Examining Host Response Time Impact: The goal is to delve into the relationship between host response times and the overall ratings of Airbnb listings providing valuable insights.

Visualizing Airbnb Listing Prices: The objective is to create visual representations of Airbnb listing prices across different cities and summarize any noteworthy trends or variations.

Analyzing Composite Scores: The task involves creating a composite score that integrates check-in experience and host communication for various districts with subsequent analysis and insights.

Calculating Listing Age and Host Tenure: This objective entails computing the age of Airbnb listings and identifying hosts who have accumulated more than ten years of hosting expertise.

Property Type Price Analysis: The task involves the creation of a visual tree map that displays average prices for various room and property types with specific attention given to the property type associated with the highest prices for entire places.

Crafting a Comprehensive City Insights Report: This objective entails the creation of a comprehensive report that presents listing prices, guest ratings, and visitor trends for multiple cities, with a particular focus on assessing changes in visitor trends in 2020 in contrast to earlier years.

Hi Connections!

Throughout this project, I had the privilege of working with a fascinating dataset from Air BNB, and I'm thrilled to highlight the 
steps I took to bring it to life. Here's a brief overview:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning with Power Query: I started by meticulously cleaning and transforming the dataset using Power Query, ensuring data integrity and accuracy. This crucial step laid the foundation for the subsequent analyses.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Creating Measures: As I delved deeper into the dataset, I identified key metrics and insights that required custom calculations. Further utilizing Power BI's capabilities to create measures that provided valuable insights and enriched the analysis.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Dashboard Creation: Leveraging the power of Power BI, I designed an intuitive and visually appealing dashboard

4Ô∏è‚É£ Analysis Report: To provide a comprehensive overview of the project findings, I prepared a detailed analysis report. This report presented detailed insights derived from the dataset.

üìë Documentation: Apart from the technical aspects, I also devoted time to document the project thoroughly. This included preparing High-Level Design (HLD), Low-Level Design (LLD), Architecture, and Wireframe documents. These documents serve as valuable references for understanding the project's structure and functionality.

Working on this project has been an enriching experience, allowing me to apply my skills in data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and documentation. 

If you're interested in learning more about this project or exploring potential collaborations, please feel free to reach out. I'm excited about what the future holds and look forward to connecting with professionals in the field.
